Game is based on Operation Linebacker II, a strategic bombing campaign conducted by the United States during the Vietnam War.

In this game, you have one ultimate target: destroy the enemy's base airports. Then you have to go home safely to enjoy your win. 

However, because of the lack of aviation gasoline, your military headquarter cannot give you a fighter with enough fuel to go straight to your enemyâ€™s base and burn it. 

As a result, you will need to land at some airports to get some fuels. There will be either fuels or enemies waiting for you. 

After destroying the enemy's base, you still have to come back to your base safely to win the game. If you run out of gasoline while flying, the enemy will absolutely catch you, kill you and you still lose.

In the future, we may add a feature that allow you to choose your favorite aircraft when you start to play the game. Each fighter can have different fuel consumption, bonus gained,... 

We may also add more airports from all over the world.
